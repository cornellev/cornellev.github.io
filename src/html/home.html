<p>Welcome, internet traveler! CEV autonomy works at the cutting edge of industry, designing and integrating
    infrastructure and algorithms for self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Right now, we're working on prototyping with small remote-controlled vehicles; our end goal is to achieve Level 2+
    autonomy, whence we will tackle an actual car.</p>

    we're working on.</p>
